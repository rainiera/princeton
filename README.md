## A HackPrinceton 2015 hack

We take a still of your face, and pool emotional/topic predictions from the Microsoft, Indico, and Clarifai APIs
to spark a conversation with an AI. (with your news feed?)

Using Wikipedia as a training set and fictional news feed data as the test set, we sort the posts into the topics
you might find interest or delight in based on your emotions, with help from gensim and Indico.

## Technical challenges

### Data encoding troubles with the still `img_handler`
- Grabs the binary data from the `WebRTC` still grab attached to `POST`  
- `WebRTC` was somewhat intuitive to use--unicode or ASCII byte-encodings not-so-much.
  Manipulates the unicode that Python gets from the `POST` request form dict
  and turns it into the appropriate ASCII byte-encoding, which is then base-64-decoded,
  and then piped into a random `UUID`-named `.png` file.  
- As a hack, I used `sshfs` to mount the `public_html` directory of my UT Austin CS account address
  into my working dir, and sent the new `.png` files into that folder, `chmod`ing per upload.  
- This renders the image into a resource that's easily accessible by APIs.
  (Although this obviously won't scale, I only have 2 GB as an undergrad.)  
- Finally, sends the `URL` via `POST` to the Microsoft Emotions API  
- *tl;dr I changed an image `data-URI` to a publicly available `URL` so it'd play better with some
  ML libraries that didn't have native Python clients, but did have RESTful APIs.* **And this took longer than anticipated.**  
- if you ask, changing to `application/octet-stream` in the HTTP header did not work for me... but I learned a lot more
  from this anyway! :grin:  

### Front-end
- One day I will get better at front-end! :beers:  

### Deployment
- One day I will get better at ops! :sushi:
